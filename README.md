# Machine_Learning_SPARK


The following project covers severeral Machine Learning algorithms. It presents the older spark.mllib as it is still not depricated. However the main focus in on the newer spark.ml, which will be the only one in use in a long run.
Some of the algorithms are:

- Random Forest

- KMeans Clustering

- Linear Regression

The code is written and tested on Jupyter Notebook using Python and pyspark as a consequence.
